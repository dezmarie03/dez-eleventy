    <p>My friends call me Dez, and I'm based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Since 2010, I've been working in a mix of product design and front-end development at technology companies like Airkit, OneSignal, WP Engine, and Bazaarvoice.</p>

    <p>Right now I'm actively looking for opportunities in either Product Design or as a UI/UX developer. For a complete breakdown of my work experience, see <a href="{{ metadata.author.linkedin }}" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

    <p>I have too many hobbies ðŸ˜…. Some that Iâ€™m actively pursuing are: playing Skyrim; making jewelry and other things out of resin; getting through my huge reading pile. If we ever get out of the pandemic, you'll find me in the nearest karaoke room.</p>

    <p>To see more of what Iâ€™ve been up to, <a href="{{ metadata.author.instagram }}" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow me on Instagram</a>.</p>
